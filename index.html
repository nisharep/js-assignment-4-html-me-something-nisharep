      <p>Cloud computing stores and access data and programs over the internet instead of hard drives, physical servers, or personal computers. In its simplest terms, cloud computing uses a network of remote servers to store, manage, and process data instead of relying on local storage devices like hard drives. A cloud is essentially a group of servers that are accessible online to store and share information.<br><br>Cloud computing is used by individuals and businesses alike to store their data remotely and access it from any computer or device with an internet connection. For example, with cloud computing, you can send files back and forth while working with colleagues, access your photos on your phone or computer, or even use programs like Google Docs or Microsoft Word.<br><br>
      Using the cloud means that the servers you''re using are not located in the exact physical location as you are; they're accessible via the internet, making it more accessible and secure. Also, you can store your data and backup essential files in case of a disaster.</p>

      <a name="types"></a><h2>Types According to Service Types</h2>
      <ul><li>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS).</li><li>Platform as a service (PaaS).</li><li>Serverless computing ((or function as a service (FaaS)).</li>
      <li>Software as a service (SaaS).</li></ul>Providers often refer to these categories as the "stack" because they build on top of one another.<br><br>
      <img  src="images/service_types.jpg" alt="Types" width="1000" height="650">
      <p><h3>IaaS - Infrastructure-as-a-Service</h3>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) means the consumer buys access to raw computing hardware over the Internet. IaaS offers infrastructure components that typically run in the provider's data center, such as:<br>
      <ul><li>Computing resources (CPU and RAM).</li>
         <li>Data storage.</li>
         <li>hardware.</li></ul>
      IaaS also offers a range of services to accompany these components, such as:
      <ul><li>Server monitoring.</li>
        <li>Log access.</li>
        <li>measures.</li>
        <li>Load balancing.</li>
        <li>Clustering.</li>
         <li>Managed services.</li>
         <li>Disaster recovery as a service, data backups and replication.</li></ul>
         IaaS offers the most basic computing services, so the in-house team of a client company must have a high level of IT expertise to run the system efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
         <h3>PaaS - Platform-as-a-Service</h3>
          Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service in which a provider delivers hardware and software tools to users. Most PaaS web-based tools aid development and end-users access them via APIs, web portals, or gateway software.<br>
          For example, a client might both develop an e-commerce website and host its key aspects (including web design, the shopping cart, checkout systems, etc.) on the cloud provider's server. The PaaS vendor provides tools needed for:<br>
         <ul><li>App design and development.</li>
         <li>Software testing and deployment.</li>
         <li>Web service and database integrations.</li></ul>
      PaaS offers all components in the IaaS package, plus hosts and manages operating systems and middleware the client needs to create and run an app. PaaS enables rapid development, so this model also offers on-demand environments for the entire software development lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p>
         <h3>Serverless Computing (or Function as a Service (FaaS))</h3>
         In a serverless computing model, the provider is the one who provisions, manages, and scales the cloud-based infrastructure. Developers get to focus on writing code while event-based services (such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions) handle the execution. Clients only pay for the number of transactions that the function executes.<br>
         Like with PaaS, the provider is responsible for all routine management (OS updates and patches, security management, capacity planning, cloud monitoring, etc.). When applied correctly, serverless computing leads to:<br>
            <ul><li>Lower costs of development.</li>
            <li>Lower costs of development.</li>
            <li>Quicker time to release.</li>
            <li>More flexibility for the in-house team.</li></ul>
      The name is a bit misleading, though. Serverless computing does not remove the use of servers, but the client's team does not have anything to do with hardware. Instead, developers focus solely on creating apps and event-handling routines, which is why serverless computing is often associated with the NoOps movement.
      </p>
      <p><h3>SaaS - Software-as-a-Service</h3>
         Software as a Service (SaaS) means a client runs the complete app on the cloud and that the provider makes it available to end users over the Internet. Google Documents is the best-known example of SaaS.<br>As the broadest form of cloud computing, SaaS enables a client to think only about how the business and customers use the software, not how to deliver or maintain it.</p>

         <a name="disadvantages"></a><h2>Disadvantages of Cloud Computing</h2><br>
         <img  src="images/disadvantages.png" alt="Disadvantages of cloud computing" width="463" height="396"><br>
            Here, are significant challenges of using Cloud Computing:
         
            <ul><li><b>Cloud Computing</b><br>
            Performance Can Vary When you are working in a cloud environment, your application is running on the server which simultaneously provides resources to other businesses. Any greedy behavior or DDOS attack on your tenant could affect the performance of your shared resource.</li>
            
            <li><b>Technical Issues</b><br>
            Cloud technology is always prone to an outage and other technical issues. Even, the best cloud service provider companies may face this type of trouble despite maintaining high standards of maintenance.</li>
            
            <li><b>Security Threat in the Cloud</b><br>
            Another drawback while working with cloud computing services is security risk. Before adopting cloud technology, you should be well aware of the fact that you will be sharing all your company&#39;s sensitive information to a third-party cloud computing service provider. Hackers might access this information.</li>
            
            <li><b>Downtime</b><br>
            Downtime should also be considered while working with cloud computing. That&#39;s because your cloud provider may face power loss, low internet connectivity, service maintenance, etc.</li>
            
            <li><b>Internet Connectivity</b><br>
            Good Internet connectivity is a must in cloud computing. You can&#39;t access cloud without an internet connection. Moreover, you don&#39;t have any other way to gather data from the cloud.</li>
            
            <li><b>Lower Bandwidth</b><br>
            Many cloud storage service providers limit bandwidth usage of their users. So, in case if your organization surpasses the given allowance, the additional charges could be significantly costly</li>
            
            <li><b>Lacks of Support</b><br>
            Cloud Computing companies fail to provide proper support to the customers. Moreover, they want their user to depend on FAQs or online help, which can be a tedious job for non-technical persons.</li>
